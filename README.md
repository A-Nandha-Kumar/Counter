# Dynamic Counter

Dynamic Counter is a simple yet interactive web project designed to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value. It also dynamically changes the color of the displayed counter based on its value.

## Features
- **Increment Button**: Increases the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement Button**: Decreases the counter value by 1.
- **Reset Button**: Resets the counter value to 0.
- **Dynamic Color Change**:
  - **Red**: When the counter value is positive.
  - **Green**: When the counter value is negative.
  - **Black**: When the counter value is zero.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the elements and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the counter logic and DOM manipulation.
- **Bootstrap**: For a responsive and clean design.

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Use the buttons to interact:
   - **DECREASE**: Subtracts 1 from the current counter value.
   - **RESET**: Resets the counter to 0 and changes the text color to black.
   - **INCREASE**: Adds 1 to the current counter value.
## Customization
- Modify the `style.css` file to update the button styles, font sizes, or background color.
- Edit the `script.js` file to add new features like setting upper and lower limits for the counter or adding sound effects.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a **set counter limit** feature.
- Include animations when the counter value changes.
- Add keyboard shortcuts for increment, decrement, and reset.
- Implement a dark mode toggle for better accessibility.

## Credits
